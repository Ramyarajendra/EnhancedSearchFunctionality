This Project is done with React ,Redux and Material UI. 

The idea behind the search functionality for this project has been implemented by filtering the matching terms obtained from the json files in redux actions and sending the filtered payload from reducer. 
Material UI is used to design.

The additional functionality that is implemented is delete. 

All the 5 categories of data are differentiated using the Material UI icon. There is a delete icon on every card which enables the user to delete on the user level, as the data is not stored in any database( the data is said to reload after every reload).

The search bar allows you to search for matching words and also has a clear search functionality. 
The search can be done on click of search button.
